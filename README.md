# 2D To 3D Environment Using Ray Casting
> This is an interactive, graphical application coded in C++ using the SDL2 framework that takes a 2D environment and simulates it in 3D. There are two screens in the main program: the 2D environment, and the 3D environment. The 2D environment can be thought of as a mini-map where the origin of the rays represents the player's position, the rays represent its field of view, and the blue lines represent walls. I then take my field of view and transition it into a 3D environment. All movement in the 2D environment is implemented accordingly in the 3D environment.
# Features
* Player's rotation depends on the position of the mouse
* Move the player with the a,s,d,w keys
* Quick termination of program by pressing 'Esc' key
